### Hello! I'm Mills Myntti Selkregg. 

I'm a 23 year old living just north of Seattle, WA. Though I was born in Alaska, I'm originally from the midwest - I grew up in Chicago, went to undegrad in Minneapolis, and now am a grad student through Colorado State. I'm getting my masters in Data Analytics with a focus in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

Outside of work, I'm a certified nutrition coach, and am fascinated by the impact nutrition has on endurance athletes. I am a certified yoga instructor, and find that the right language is vital for connecting two people in understanding. As my love language is cooking, I am involved in the local food scene and have worked every job at and behind the counter of a restaurant. I spend my weekends trail running, rock climbing, practicing yoga, doing homework, cooking, and reading science fiction short stories. 

I am excited to be part of the coding community as I launch my career. 

Currently, I'm a research intern at NASA's Langley Research Center studying Uncertainty Quantification. Ultimately, I'm trying to develop a cheaper, faster, and better Monte Carlo to further my dream of having human colonies on other planets (or moons). 

I'm looking to learn even more about machine learning, artificial intelligence, theoretical statistics, and anything else.
